### HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor IoT project

The initial boilerplate for an IoT project that will use the Photon 2 (Particle.io) and a HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor.

Other things that are in the pipeline: Particle.io's Cloud API / Webhooks, a Node.js app to receive the webhook data, a very minimal Granfana dashboard
and maybe a database to store the results.
