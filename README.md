### Audio Over TCP Example

This is just an working example of how to send audio over tcp via the Adafruit PDM MEMS Microphone Breakout. The code is taken from the excellent 
Microphone_PDM library (https://github.com/particle-iot/Microphone_PDM), I am not the author. Very useful library!

This is mostly a storage place while I slowly add to this project while I also learn more about the hardware side of things and C++.
